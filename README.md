# InstaClone

This application is a simplified version of Instagram, that tries to implement the basics of a social media system, but is still not yet complete. 

I have built almost the entire interface for the front-end.
For the back-end, it was done 100% in Firebase just for simplicity. 

Users in this application can:
  - create an account
  - take images 
  - store and retrieve images from Firebase
  - search for other users
  - follow / unfollow other users
  - view other users' images
  
  
What's left to be implemented:
  - notification interface
  - messaging system
  - any bugs that needs to be patched
